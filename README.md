# ShiftSwiper
A Facebook chat bot that looks for when coworkers in my group chat are trying to give away shifts. When it detects that a coworker is giving away their shift it then checks the dates I am available against the dates in the message. If there are any shifts I can take the chat bot then auto replies that I will take the shift.

The motivation behind this is that many of my coworkers are quick to take shifts that people post. So instead of constantly looking at the group chat waiting to see if anyone posts thier shift I can just let this run in the background and check every now and then when I my bot has taken a shift
